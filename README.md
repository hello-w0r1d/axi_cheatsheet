A quick reference/ cheatsheet for the AMBA Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI)

With ever evolving standards in the Computer Architecture domain, it sometimes gets tedious to browse through a specification document that has hundreds of pages. I decided to share this document which I created as quick notes while understanding the AXI3/4 specification.  There are a lot of cheatsheets for complex software concepts but the same is lacking in the hardware world. I felt that  illustrative highlighted tables and a sheet that captures all pieces of critical information about the AXI3/4 specification can come in very handy.
